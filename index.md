Hello! I am a second year PhD student at University of Minnesota - Twin Cities in the department of Computer Science and Engineering and my work is in the capture and simulation of natural movement. Whether the movement is from humans or other elements in the natural world, the computer vision, machine learning, motion planning, and graphics algorithms involved are interesting and beautiful. This research has applications for computer animation, autonomous vehicles, and assistive technologies.<br>
  
<br>Outside of academics, I am passionate about accessibility and disability activism, adventuring through the outdoors, embroidery and other crafts, high fantasy and other great literature, really good food, and my cat named Ada. I cannot wait to connect with you!

Now looking for summer 2022 research internship opportunities in motion capture, computer vision, graphics, and planning.<br>
<br>Always looking for new collaborators, mentorship opportunities, and opportunities to give back to the community.<br>
<br>Thanks for visiting! Contact me with any and all inquiries.

<font size=4>We are developing a software tool for clinitians that allow deeper and more quantitative, objective, and efficient evaluation of bilateral coordination ability. This type of evaluation is used particularly in clinical rehabilitation for children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy but is applicable to any person with asymmetrical movement impairment. We use available optical motion capture and skeleton fitting algorithms to extract pose information, a variety of interactive data visualization techniques, and deep neural networks to automate information generation as much as possible so the clinitian can focus on using their expertise to develop treatment and care plans.</font>
